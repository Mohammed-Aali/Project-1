# Mohammed Ali' Personal Portfolio Website

This is my final project for CS50, my first computer science course. I built a personal portfolio website using Flask, Python, CSS, HTML and JavaScript to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements as a web developer.

You can watch a video presentation of my project [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). The actual video is cooming soon.

## Features

- A homepage with my name, animated, bio
- A skills section with the technologies and tools that I use for web development
- A responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices
- A user-friendly interface with buttons and beautiful colors

## Technologies

- Flask: a micro web framework for Python that handles routing, templating, and server-side logic
- Python: a high-level programming language that handles data processing and backend logic
- CSS: a style sheet language that defines the appearance and layout of the website
- HTML: a markup language that defines the structure and content of the website
- JavaScript: a scripting language that enables dynamic and interactive features on the website
